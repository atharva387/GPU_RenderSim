# 🚀 GPU-RenderSim

🧊 Real-time 3D rendering demo in C++ using OpenGL. Features a free-fly camera, multiple rotating cubes, depth buffer, custom shaders, and transformation matrices.

Built from scratch using GLFW, GLAD, and GLM — demonstrating core GPU pipeline understanding and graphics programming foundations.
